# Retaurants

Using XML and XSLT to generate this jQuery site is probably the last way that I would have like to have done this. It's made it very hard to write the Javascript for each restaurant page. But hey...that's what the courseowork spec asks for.. ðŸ’©

## Tough issues faced
I'll add descriptions and links to these tough issues soon

- Map reloading on page show
- Persistent nav bar flickering tranparency on page switch
- Adding maps and markers for each page
- Adding markers for each restaurant to the main map and zooming out to user location
