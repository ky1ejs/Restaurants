			We’ve travelled the world in search of the perfect steak, but have found that beef from well-loved native cattle breeds reared right here in Britain has more flavour than anything we’ve tried on our travels.

			We’ve travelled the world in search of the perfect steak, but have found that beef from well-loved native cattle breeds reared right here in Britain has more flavour than anything we’ve tried on our travels.

			Our dictionary-thick steaks cooked over real charcoal have received plenty of ‘best steak in London’ plaudits, but we’re not resting on our laurels. We’d love your feedback so we can keep on improving. It will go straight to us and we’ll always respond as quickly as we can.

			Hakkasan Hanway Place is the original restaurant of Hakkasan that opened in 2001 in London.
		</short-description>
		<long-description>
			Designed by famed designer Christian Liaigre, the space embodies the Hakkasan design ethos of the modern ethnic now found in Hakkasan restaurants around the world. Wooden screens and latticing made of dark English oak is the same material used for the 16-metre bar, and the Ling Ling dining area evokes traditional Chinoiserie decadence, punctuated by black and gold traditionally-drawn panels. An open-plan kitchen is visible from the restaurant, making the activity in the kitchen part of the restaurant’s theatre.

			The rooftop OXO Tower Restaurant, Brasserie and Bar has proved a dazzling success since opening in 1996. The formal restaurant, more relaxed brasserie and cocktail bar all boast stunning views across the Thames to Charing Cross and the City of London.

			The interior features a unique ceiling with blue neon lights, creating a beautiful moonlit effect in the evenings. Leather-clad bars and slate tables add to the subtly luxurious feel. The OXO Tower Restaurant serves beautifully presented modern British dishes while the OXO Brasserie’s open plan kitchen produces intense flavours with global influences.
